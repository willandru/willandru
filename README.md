 👋 Hi, I’m @willandru
- 👀 I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, Digital Electronics, Control of Systems, Fabrication of Technologies, and Developing Medical Devices, among many, many other things I am passionate about.
- I'm a Bioengineer and Data Scientist, looking for learning all about Electronic Engineering, Networking and Telecommunication Engineering, Medicine, Biology, Maths, Phisics, Administration and Entrepreneurships. I am also pursuing a Master's in AI, DataScience, Digital Electronics , Molecular Biology or Biomedical Engineering. Those are my aspirations in life. At the end of my life i want to be a BioHacker to asses positevly in medical issues and an Systems Hacker as i love cybersecurity.
- I'm a Scientist.
- I'm an Engineer.
- Currently, I'm working on an automated lens system using Electromyographic Signals (EMG) to provide biofeedback to the system for correcting Presbyopia (see: ASTHENOPIA, Optotune liquid lenses, gtec.at )
- 🌱 I was learning ROS, SpeechREcognition, MarkovModels, Bioinformatics, Biology Science, LINEAR REGRESSION, Analogic Circuits, MATHS🐧🐧🐧, Digital Circuits, FPGA, Microcontrollers, Rasberry Pi, Arduinos adn Microchips.
- I woudl like to learn:  PHP, TRANSFORMERS, CNN, RNN, GANGs, HMM, Gaussian Mixtures, Deep Learning, FPGA designs


I'm currently working on these proyects:
    1. Speech Recognition for robotic atomations using Deep Learning. 
    2. Create an algorithm for detecting vowels >> Use it to segment audio data by detecting silent moments and vowels, createa huge database of syllabes >> Create Language model for making Speech Recognition.
    

I'm currently working on this proyect:
    1. "The Controllability of Automated Focal system controled by biofeedback (EMG) for the correction of Presbypia"
